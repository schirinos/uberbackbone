uberbackbone
============

A set of enhanced backbone.js views, models and collections

## UberBackbone.View
This enhanced view allows a multitude of functionality not found in the basic backbone view
* Manage child views
* Automatically attach external html template
* Automatically cache jQuery objects on template dom elements labeled with ***data-bind*** attributes
* Generate [Stickit](https://github.com/NYTimes/backbone.stickit) bindings from markup using ***data-stickit*** attributes

## UberBackbone.ListView
Provides boilerplate and helper methods to create list based backbone view.

## UberBackbone.Model
This is a very minimal enhancement. All it provides is shortcut functions to merge properties directly onto the
model object.

## UberBackbone.Collection
Allows you to sort the collection by a field name on the models contained in the collection.
